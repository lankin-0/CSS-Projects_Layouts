            Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a
            dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught

            You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the
            first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them
            to be. I'll show you.
