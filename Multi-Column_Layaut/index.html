          <h2>Ferrari Typo 500 F-2</h2>
          <p>
            The Ferrari 500 is a racing car produced by Ferrari for the 1952
            Formula One Season. During the first two years of it's use in F1 (it
            was used by other constructors until 1957), it became the most
            successful car in the history of Formula One, securing victories in
            all of the first 14 events in which it was used. The 500 was driven
            by Alberto Ascari to the World Drivers' Championship in 1952 and
            1953, including a 9 race (7 if non-attendances are included) streak
            of consecutive victories.

          <p>
            The Ferrari 312T2 was a Formula One car developed by Ferrari for the
            1976 Formula One Season. A B-spec chassis was also used for 1977 and
            the first two races of 1978. This was the car in which Niki Lauda
            suffered severe burns during the 1976 German Grand Prix. In 1977
            Lauda won the second World title that he had lost out on the year
            before by sheer bad luck, thanks to a much improved 312 T2.
